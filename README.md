### Built with

### What I learned

For this section I wanted to challenge myself and I started using SCSS to stylize some things, custom variables to hold the fonts, colors and a mixin for the media query

### Continued development

For the future I plan on studying more about SCSS and how can I implement it better in my mision to conquer responsiveness.
